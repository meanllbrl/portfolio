## The Shift to Intent

Product management has traditionally been about designing efficient funnels. We ask users to click here, fill this form, and navigate there.

**Agentic AI changes this.**

Instead of designing navigation paths, we are now designing *context windows* and *decision heuristics*.

### The New Stack

1. **Context Layer**: What does the agent know?
2. **Tools Layer**: What can the agent do?
3. **Safety Layer**: What *shouldn't* the agent do?

## Building Rovo

When building Rovo, we realized that users didn't want to browse travel options. They wanted to *be* traveled.

> "The best interface is no interface."

This is why we built a headless architecture first...
